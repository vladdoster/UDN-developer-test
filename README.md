# UDN-developer-test
## Vlad Doster attempt

A key project managed by DBMI is the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN). The UDN platform is a web app that collects information about participants and allows hospitals, medical centers, and research staff share and review participant information.

For this test we would like you to create a small web app. Specifically you should create two views: 1) add a participant by presenting a form that gathers details about a participant and 2) display a list of all participants with their data in a table.

The form should have character input fields for

Participant Name
Participant Age
Does Participant have any siblings?
Known environmental exposures
Known genetic mutations
After submitting information you should be redirected to the list view where each participant and the values they entered are present.

Bonus: Add a dropdown box for each participant that would have 3 values (Not Reviewed, Reviewed - Accepted, Reviewed - Not Accepted). Changing of this dropdown should save this field alongside the participant data.
